* There are no solutions, just tradeoffs. Don't think there's a perfect tech stack.

* Done is better than perfect. Velocity matters. This generally means pick something you know if delivery is important.

* Boring tech tends to be reliable. Things like PHP, Rails, Django, etc. These tools have been around a long time and ironed out the kinks. Lots of documentation and tooling to make your life easier. Odds are very low your new fancy idea has any requirements that boring tech can't deliver on. This counts for every layer of the stack (frontend, DB, OS, etc).

* Shu ha ri
  
* Go for the simplest solution

* Consider how you would solve your immediate problem without adding anything new

* long-term costs of keeping a system working reliably vastly exceed any inconveniences you encounter while building it
  - well, we could do it, with the current stack, but it would be too hard

* Just Ship.

* When making decisions, instead of asking ourselves which option will give us the best results, we should be asking which option will give us good-enough results under the widest range of future states of the world.
