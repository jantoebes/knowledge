# Static site generators
- Gatsby
- Next.js

Advantages
- you will get a performant website or application
- Good seo
- Exceptional Developer Experience: caching, code splitting, prefetching,

routing.
- Create React App in which you need to handle most of the configuration and architectural decisions by yourself


Nextjs seems to be better (not using graphql, better build performance)

> Now that NextJS supports next-generation static site rendering, I recommend using it instead of Gatsby. I believe that (almost) anything you can do with Gatsby, you can do with NextJS. And since NextJS is used more in industry, using NextJS in your next personal project can help you when youâ€™re looking for a job.
